# Themes Architecture (Contract v1.0)

Updated: 2026-08-07

## Ownership

| Concern | Canonical doc | Update when… |
|---|---|---|
| Theme **authoring** (bridge API table, `theme.xml` fields, HTML/JS patterns) | [`cluster-widgets/Themes/THEME_GUIDE.md`](../../cluster-widgets/Themes/THEME_GUIDE.md) | New/changed bridge methods, telemetry keys, manifest fields, or authoring workflow |
| Theme **system** (layout on disk, APK vs OTA, compatibility policy) | **This file** | Deploy path, catalog branch, contract/bridge versioning rules, or host-side theme loading changes |
| Agent guardrails (do not break `v1.0`) | `AGENTS.md` (repo root; may be local-only) | Policy changes only — keep thin; link here / THEME_GUIDE |

Do **not** duplicate the full bridge reference into `docs/`. Link to `THEME_GUIDE.md`.

## Model

Cluster UI is **theme-owned**. The Android host loads a self-contained `app.html` in a WebView (`InstrumentProjector2`), exposes `window.Android`, and streams telemetry the theme subscribed to. Screens, menus, and navigation live in the theme — not in hardcoded Java screen classes.

### Bridge version vs contract version

1. **Bridge** (`minBridgeVersion` / host `CURRENT_BRIDGE_VERSION = "1.0.0"`)
   - Native `@JavascriptInterface` surface on `window.Android` (`subscribe`, `setClusterBackground`, …).
   - Back-compat polyfills: `CompatTranslationLayer.kt`.

2. **Contract** (`contractVersion = "v1.0"`)
   - Telemetry key dictionary, steering key-event protocol, `theme.xml` shape, layout boundaries.
   - Filtered by `ThemeManager.kt` / `TelasScreen.kt` — incompatible themes are hidden from the catalog.

**Breaking change rule:** if existing `v1.0` themes would miss data or break, stop and create a new contract version (e.g. `v2.0`) instead of silently changing `v1.0`.

## On-disk layout

```text
cluster-widgets/
├── source/
│   ├── noncontract/          # Legacy themes (not contract-compatible)
│   └── v1.0/                 # Active contract sources (default, minimalist, …)
│       └── shared/           # Shared bridge/adapters used by v1.0 themes
├── Themes/
│   ├── THEME_GUIDE.md        # Author guide (API + build)
│   └── v1.0/<theme>/         # Packaged OTA artifacts (app.html + theme.xml + assets)
└── …
```

Unless the user asks otherwise, edit **`source/v1.0/`**, not `noncontract/`.

## Default (APK) vs dynamic (OTA)

| Kind | Source | Build output | How the car gets it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Default** | `source/v1.0/default/` | `app/src/main/res/raw/app.html` + `app/src/main/assets/Default/theme.xml` | Bundled in the APK |
| **OTA** (e.g. Minimalist) | `source/v1.0/<theme>/` | `Themes/v1.0/<theme>/app.html` + `theme.xml` | In-app catalog downloads from GitHub (`ThemeManager`) |

OTA publish checklist:

1. Bump `<version>` in the theme’s `theme.xml`.
2. `npm run build` in the theme source (Parcel + `inline.js`).
3. Commit **source and** `Themes/v1.0/<theme>/` artifacts.
4. Push to the branch `ThemeManager` crawls (currently `preview` in `bobaoapae/haval-app-tool-multimidia` — see `ThemeManager.THEME_REPO_URL`).

`theme.xml` must ship with `app.html`; the updater compares `<version>` there.

## Published catalogue sources

The production picker aggregates two deliberately separate paths on the same `preview` branch:

- `Themes/v1.0` for contract-compatible themes such as Minimalist;
- `Themes` only for the explicitly allowlisted legacy packages `SportRed` and `SportRedLite`.

The legacy root is not a second contract catalogue. `ThemeManager` skips every other folder there,
requires the exact expected folder/name/version/main-file metadata, downloads Sport from that root,
and activates it only when the complete three-file package matches the host-pinned SHA-256 allowlist.
A renamed, repackaged, extra-file or hash-mismatched package fails closed. Sport therefore remains a
temporary legacy compatibility path and must not be moved into `v1.0` without a real contract port.

`fetchPublishedThemes()` tolerates one catalogue source being temporarily unavailable so a Sport
failure does not hide Minimalist and a v1.0 failure does not hide an otherwise valid pinned Sport
package. If both sources fail, the picker reports the catalogue error as before.

## User-owned display mode

The active cluster display mode is always the persisted `display` selected by the driver.
Starting CarPlay, Android Auto, navigation or another projected app must not rewrite it.
In particular, `Mapa` is an explicit option in the theme's display picker; it is never an
automatic side effect of projection.

`navigation_display_mode` and `app_display_mode`, when a theme declares them, may tune
projection viewport/mask geometry only. They must not replace `display` or change the
theme's visual mode. The host also applies `ProjectionDisplayHtmlPolicy` to trusted legacy
Sport packages so they obey the same invariant.

## Compatibility and package trust

The host loads only packages whose `contractVersion` is `v1.0` and whose
`minBridgeVersion` is supported. The two installed legacy Sport packages remain available
through a temporary compatibility adapter only when all packaged files match the
host-pinned SHA-256 allowlist; they are not presented as contract-v1 themes. A changed or
unrecognized legacy package is rejected rather than receiving the native bridge.

That temporary adapter also translates the host's canonical one-way
`window.onCardChanged(cardId)` notification to the legacy
`window.control('cardId', cardId)` state update when, and only when, the trusted Sport
bundle has no `onCardChanged` handler. New `v1.0` themes do not receive this fallback and
must implement the canonical handler.

The same trusted legacy boundary covers wheel navigation for those two immutable packages. Since
they do not implement `window.onKeyEvent`, the host may translate the result of its pre-existing
Sport menu state machine to `focus`, `showScreen` and `control`. This is a private compatibility
adapter, not a contract method: v1.0 themes continue to own all internal navigation through
`onKeyEvent` and must not depend on host-driven focus or screen changes.

## Fixed OEM foreground and reserved zones

`READY`, the detected speed-limit sign and the ESP indicator are owned by the OEM compositor and
remain above the theme WebView on Display 3. Themes cannot hide or reposition them. Consequently,
every theme must treat their 1920×720 coordinates as no-draw zones for gauge marks, decorative
lines and important information.

The Theme Lab injects one simulator-only foreground layer into every source, OTA and legacy theme
in its catalog. This keeps all previews on the same physical coordinates, uses the maximum CSS
stacking level, and replaces any duplicate theme-owned mock. Nothing from that development layer
is copied into the APK or an OTA package; the real vehicle supplies the OEM layer.

This rule documents an existing physical boundary and is therefore an additive `v1.0`
clarification: no bridge API, telemetry dictionary, manifest schema or compatibility filter changes.
Exact coordinates and authoring guidance are canonical in
[`THEME_GUIDE.md` — Fixed native foreground](../../cluster-widgets/Themes/THEME_GUIDE.md#fixed-native-foreground-mandatory-exclusion-zones).
Other fixed indicators remain **A confirmar** until their vehicle positions are mapped.

## Native masks (OEM chrome cover)

The cluster still shows **OEM** gauges/strips outside what a WebView alone can paint. Themes
declare `<nativeMasks>` in `theme.xml`; `InstrumentProjector2` draws those regions natively on
Display 3 (wallpaper × optional `d3_mask.png`) so stock chrome can be hidden and the theme
owns the look.

When AA/CarPlay/an app is on D3, the host punches a **hole** in the mask layer for that app
rect so projection is not buried under the masks.

Author details (XML schema, named children, JS APIs): [`THEME_GUIDE.md` — Native masks](../../cluster-widgets/Themes/THEME_GUIDE.md#native-masks-covering-oem-chrome).

Host touchpoints: `ThemeManager` (parse), `InstrumentProjector2` (`updateNativeMaskViews`, punch), `ThemeBridgeImpl.setNativeMaskState` / `setNativeMasksConfig`.

## Additive Android Auto CLUSTER keys (v1.0)

These are additive. Existing themes that never subscribe or call the new method keep working. No contract `v2.0`.

| Key / method | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `app.androidauto.session` | `stopped` \| `active` | From Autolink GET_LINK_STATUS 3/7/8. Also on `EVENT_CHANGED` / snapshot. |
| `app.navigation.directions` | JSON (`active`, `street`, `distance`, `turn`, `remaining_s`, `remaining_m`, …) | Existing stub; filled from the NAV channel when hooked. Inactive = `{"active":false}`. `remaining_s` is trip ETA in seconds. |
| `aaClusterInDash` | boolean via `control()` | CLUSTER Surface under the theme WebView. Treat like `projectionMirrorInDash` for masks. Do **not** rewrite persisted `display`. |
| `setAaClusterMapEnabled(boolean)` | — | Theme request to attach/tear down D3 CLUSTER Surface. MAIN stays on D0. |

Handshake constraint: CLUSTER must be advertised before the AAP session starts. Theme enable after `session=active` only attaches the Surface; the Service patch advertises CLUSTER when mounted.

## Host-side touchpoints

- `ThemeManager.kt` — catalog crawl, download, contract filter, metadata parse (incl. `nativeMasks`)
- `ThemeBridgeImpl.kt` / bridge translators — `window.Android` implementation
- `InstrumentProjector2.kt` — WebView load, theme swap, native masks, JS readiness / heartbeat
- `TelasScreen.kt` — UI listing of compatible themes
- `DisplayAppLauncher.kt` — D3 projection prep / mask punch coordination

## Risks

- Editing bridge/contract without a compatibility check breaks installed OTA themes.
- Building Default but forgetting APK raw/assets paths leaves the car on stale HTML.
- Building an OTA theme but not pushing `Themes/v1.0/` means the catalog never sees the update.
- On case-insensitive disks, never introduce a parallel `DOCS/` folder beside `docs/`.
