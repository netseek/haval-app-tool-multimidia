# Classic Theme Layout & Visual Architecture

This document describes the design, structure, and compilation workflow for the classic themes (`basic` and `basic-light`) within the Haval Shisuku / Impulse dashboard widgets.

## Reorganization History

Historically, the custom dark and light themes were named `air-control` and `air-control-light` (referenced internally as `Basico` and `Light`). In the recent architecture revision, these were relocated and clean-coded into:
- `basic` (Dark Mode classic theme)
- `basic-light` (Light Mode classic theme)
- `default` (Sporty layout theme)

During this transition, the classic themes lost their top status bar backgrounds and the center-top status container (displaying the clock, current gear, and EV mode).

---

## Root Cause & Bug Restoration

### 1. Basic (Dark Theme) Status Bar Recovery
- **Issue**: Sporty-layout specific styling overrides (`.display-esportivo`) were carried over from the legacy `air-control` implementation.
- **Root Cause**: The dark stylesheet (`basic/src/styles/night.style.css`) contained aggressive negation overrides (`#app:not(.display-esportivo)`) that forcefully hid the `.dashboard-top-center` container (`display: none !important`) and stripped `.mask-top-bar` and `.dashboard-bottom-gauges` of their linear gradients (`background-image: none !important`).
- **Fix**: Removed the negations for top/bottom bar backgrounds and the clock/gear/mode containers, while retaining the hard-stops for actual sporty-only gauges (`.dashboard-speed-esportivo-widget` and `.dashboard-sport-fixed-overlay`) so they remain hidden in classic mode.

### 2. Basic-Light (Light Theme) Visual Depth Restoration
- **Issue**: The status bars (`.mask-top-bar` and `.mask-bottom-bar`) were visually flat or perceived as missing, blending completely with the background.
- **Root Cause**: The light stylesheet (`basic-light/src/styles/light.style.css`) used solid white gradients (`#ffffff` and `rgba(255,255,255,0.5)`) and solid white shadows (`var(--mask-circle-bg) = #ffffff`) over a pure white page background, resulting in zero contrast.
- **Fix**: Updated both status bars with elegant translucent overlay gradients and soft, premium shadows (`box-shadow: 0 4px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)`) to establish visual separation and a premium glassmorphic feel on the white backdrop.

### 3. Basic-Light (Light Theme) Bottom Gauges Harmonization
- **Issue**: The bottom fuel and battery gauges did not align correctly compared to the basic dark theme, and the fuel/battery icons were completely invisible (white-on-white). Additionally, empty progress bar tracks were invisible against the white page background.
- **Root Causes**:
  1. The layout elements in the light stylesheet (`basic-light/src/styles/light.style.css`) had a height of `72px` and lacked the matching negative margins (`margin-right: -40px`, `margin-left: -30px`) that are used in `night.style.css` to align gauges perfectly under the dial circles.
  2. The SVG icons used in `dashboardInfo.js` were hardcoded to white fills (`fill="white"` / `fill="#fff"`), blending completely with the light background.
  3. The `.segment-track` used `var(--color-white-15)`, which rendered as white on white, rendering empty track segments invisible.
  4. The fuel quantity/unit display in `basic-light` was using a generic class name `.fuel-percent` with default styling, whereas the dark theme used `.fuel-liters` which has custom right-align, top offset, and spacing optimizations.
- **Fixes**:
  1. Updated the light theme's stylesheet container height to `60px` and added matching negative margins for perfect alignment.
  2. Substituted base64 SVG fills in the light theme to `fill="black"` so the icons stand out on the white dashboard background.
  3. Changed the `.segment-track` background color to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)` so that empty progress bar tracks are clearly visible.
  4. Ported `.fuel-liters` CSS styles to `light.style.css` and updated `dashboardInfo.js` to utilize `.fuel-liters` instead of `.fuel-percent` for fuel display, making layouts completely identical across themes.

## Structural Integrity

The core UI structure and layout initialization remains identical between the two classic themes, shared via:
- `basic/src/core/components/display/mask.js` (Background layer containing `.mask-top-bar`)
- `basic/src/core/components/dashboardInfo.js` (Foreground layer containing `.dashboard-top-center`)
- `basic/src/core/main.js` (Layout tree compilation)

The top-center widgets are injected into the DOM container at layout time, ensuring they float above the background mask overlay layers (`z-index: 140` vs. `z-index: 1`).

---

## Compilation & Packaging Workflow

All custom themes are built as unified, self-contained single-page HTML files (all CSS/JS inlined with dynamic assets Base64-encoded).

### 1. Build and Compile
From each theme directory (`cluster-widgets/basic` or `cluster-widgets/basic-light`), execute the Parcel compiler and inliner:
```powershell
npm run build
```
This automatically:
- Builds the optimized assets into `./dist/`.
- Runs `./inline.js` to parse and embed all external scripts, stylesheets, and assets.
- Copies the final unified file directly to the Android resources directory (`app/src/main/res/raw/app.html` or `app_light.html`).

### 2. Theme Package Distribution
For runtime theme discovery, the unified output must be manually placed inside the `Themes` package directory:
- **Basic (Dark)**: Copy `basic/dist/app.html` to `cluster-widgets/Themes/Basic/index.html`.
- **Basic Light**: Copy `basic-light/dist/app_light.html` to `cluster-widgets/Themes/BasicLight/app_light.html`.
- **Version Bump**: Increment the `<version>` tag in `theme.xml` by `0.0.1` (e.g., to `1.0.4`) to trigger the app's internal cache-refresh and update system.

## Odometer & Maintenance Warning Y-Axis Displacement

To ensure optimal layout balance when showing either a single line (odometer value only) or two lines (odometer value + maintenance/revision warnings), the widget uses a dynamic class-toggling mechanism.

### 1. JavaScript State Integration
In `odometerInfo.js`, the widget updates its container's class list dynamically based on the active display criteria:
- **Single-Line Mode**: Applied when only the odometer is active. The wrapper is assigned `.odometer-text-wrapper.single-line`.
- **Double-Line Mode**: Applied during startup flashing or active maintenance warnings. The wrapper is assigned `.odometer-text-wrapper.double-line`.

### 2. Styling and Y-Axis Displacement

The stylesheets (`night.style.css` / `light.style.css`) govern the exact vertical position via CSS transforms tailored for each theme's contrast and display parameters:

- **Basic (Dark Mode - `night.style.css`)**:
  - `.odometer-text-wrapper.single-line`: Uses `transform: translateY(-6px);` with larger text sizing to center the odometer perfectly.
  - `.odometer-text-wrapper.double-line`: Uses `transform: translateY(0px);` to balance the two text lines nicely.

- **Basic-Light (Light Mode - `light.style.css`)**:
  - `.odometer-text-wrapper.single-line`: Uses `transform: translateY(0px);` with larger text sizing to center the single-line odometer.
  - `.odometer-text-wrapper.double-line`: Uses `transform: translateY(6px);` to balance the two text lines nicely and prevent bottom mask collision.

## Default / Embedded Theme Update Architecture

To allow seamless upgrades of the built-in sporty theme without requiring app updates, the Default theme has been unified between raw assets and the GitHub update workflow.

### 1. Unified Card & Git SHA/Size Comparison
- Previously, a hardcoded "Default (Original)" card and a remote "Default" card from GitHub were shown separately.
- They have been merged into a single, cohesive **"Default" Card**.
- If the Default theme is not downloaded locally in `themesDir/Default`, the app reads from raw resources (`R.raw.app` / `app.html`).
- To check if the embedded version differs from the latest one on GitHub, the app retrieves the `size` and `sha` of the remote `index.html` file through GitHub's repo contents API.
- The app then calculates the local Git-compatible SHA-1 blob hash:
  `SHA-1("blob " + localSize + "\u0000" + localBytes)`
- If either the size or the SHA-1 hash is different, the app sets `hasUpdate = true`, prompting the user to click **"Atualizar" / "Baixar"**.

### 2. Selective Overriding & Fallback
- When downloaded, the updated Default theme is placed under `files/themes/Default`.
- The `ACTIVE_CUSTOM_THEME` preference is updated to `"Default"`, instructing `InstrumentProjector2` to load the custom HTML file from `files/themes/Default/index.html` instead of the raw resource.
- A **Delete / Excluir** action is provided for the Default theme when it has been downloaded. Clicking it deletes the downloaded folder and resets `ACTIVE_CUSTOM_THEME` to `""`, cleanly falling back to the raw APK resource.

## Theme Configurations Metadata Schema (theme.xml)

To support dynamic and flexible theme configuration without hardcoding options in the native app, a declarative `<configurations>` schema is supported inside the `theme.xml` descriptor. The Android app parses these options at discovery time and automatically generates a premium Jetpack Compose dialog containing custom controls.

### XML Schema Layout:
```xml
<configurations>
    <configuration>
        <id>[unique_setting_id]</id>
        <label>[Friendly display title in form]</label>
        <type>[boolean | text | number | combo]</type>
        <default>[default_fallback_value_string]</default>
        <stateVariable>[javascript_reactive_state_variable]</stateVariable>
        <options>[comma_separated_values_for_combo_types_only]</options>
    </configuration>
</configurations>
```

### Supported Variable Types:
1. **`boolean`**: Renders as a native switch toggle.
2. **`text`**: Renders as a standard text input field.
3. **`number`**: Renders as a numeric-only input field.
4. **`combo`**: Renders as a dropdown selection box. Dropdown options are defined as a comma-separated list under `<options>` (e.g. `<options>Eco,Normal,Sport</options>`).

### JNI Scope Resolution:
To prevent settings desynchronization between different themes sharing the same `stateVariable` names, settings are saved and sandboxed under key `"theme_config_[themeFolderName]_[stateVariable]"`. The JNI bridge resolves these transparently so the active theme can query using the simple `stateVariable` name.
